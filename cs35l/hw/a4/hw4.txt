# Q1.
The performance is improved because the bug of overriding is fixed.
The buggy version might cause ambiguity when using both two options.
Thus, I think the performance of ls gets better in terms of clarity.

# Q2.
Becuase -A -a and -a -A behave differently unlike before, 
any bash scripts using ls with these two options might be affected. 
This modification might introduce incompatibility
between programs in the company. 


# Q3.
python randline.py /dev/null

output:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
        main()
    File "randline.py", line 64, in main
        sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
    File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
        return random.choice(self.lines)
    File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 277,
    in choice
        return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if
        seq is empty
    IndexError: list index out of range

This is because file null does not contain any lines for ranline.py to read. 
But the function random.choice do not allow empty sequence. 
Thus, an IndexError is raised.

# Q4.
python3 randline.py /dev/null

output:
File "randline.py", line 65
          except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                            ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because python2 and python3 has some syntax differences. 
python2 IOError returns a 2-tuple while python3 returns only one.

# Q5.
Performance normally. 
Bug in Q4 fixed in shuf.py, 
compatible with both python2 and python3.
