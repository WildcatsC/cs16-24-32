#2. In an unpatched version of diffutils, create a new branch called quote
with the following command:
   git checkout v3.0 -b quote

#3. 
I applied my patch to v3.0 with the patch command.
   patch -p1 < ~/Desktop/CS35L/test/quote-3.0-patch.txt

The following output led me to believe that the patch was applied successfully.

Output:

#5. 
I updated the changelog entry in quote-3.0-patch.txt with the previous command.

   emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt:
        This patch was created in response to a change in customer requirements
        restricting the use of left and right single quotation marks, such that
        quotes should be "'like this' or "like this", not `like this'". The patch
        only alters occurences of the left quotation mark in constant character
        strings, per the customer's request for low overhead. This means that any
        updates to commentary and documentation present in the maint: quote like
        this patch that this is derived from, are not present in this patch.

#6. 
To commit my changes to my working branch, I used the following commands.
   git clean -f
   git add *
   git commit -F ../ChangeLog

#7. 
I then used the prescribed command to generate a patch file.
   git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt

#8. 
To verify that my partner's patch worked I checked out a new branch named
partner, applied the patch with git am and then built diffutils with the same
set of steps in the lab. 
	git checkout v3.0 -b partner
	git am < formatted-patch.txt
	./bootstrap
	wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
	patch -p1 < diffutils-gets.diff
	File to patch: lib/stdio.in.h
	./configure
	make
	make check
	src/diff . -
	src/diff --help

#9. 
To check if my ChangeLog worked, I ran the command make distdir. I then inspected
the ChangeLog file in the directory it created. As expected, my changelog entry
was present.

    make distdir
    cd diffutils-3.0.1-d7b86/
    cat ChangeLog | head

#10. 
From the commit history, I found the latest commit was before
2015/01/25. The merge message is "Merge branch 'master' into xwidget", and the commit
was made by Joakim Verona.

My view of the mergepoint was that the features independently implemented by Paul Eggert,
Lars Ingebrigsten, and Stefan Monnier rooted at the last merge before 2015/01/25 were merged
into the master branch. The subwindows present in XQuartz show changes from  pre and post
merging, comments, and a diagram of the branch history.
