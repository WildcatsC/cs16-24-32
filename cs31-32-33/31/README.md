Midterm Notes:
	1. identifiers(all user-defined variable names) cannot start with number, case sensitive. 
	2. 1 byte = 8 bits. float = 4 byte, double = 8 byte = double float.
	3. A 32-Bit Floating Point Value Has Three Components: sign bit, exponent(location of decimal point), mantissa(significant digits) 
	4. "\n" new line, as well as endl;
	5. Source Code(.cpp) ->(preprocessor)-> Object files(.o) ->(linker)-> Executable(a.out)
	6.
